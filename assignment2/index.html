    <h2>Solution 2&3: Discrete-Time CBD simulator - Together</h2>

     <p>
	 For this part we filled in all the blanks in the file <a href="./CBDMultipleOutput/Source/CBD.py"><tt>CBD.py</tt></a>. The compute functions now use the input signals of the block
	 to get the correct signal generated by the block. How these input signals are used exactly depend on the kind of block we are computing.
	 <br><br>
	 The getDependencies function in the class DelayBlock also needed to be implemented. This block has no algebraic dependencies, except for the first iteration (time = 0).
	 During the first iteration, it depends on the block connected to the IC port. This is implemented as a condition on the current iteration and returns the block connected
	 to IC if the iteration is 0, else it returns and empty list.
	 <br><br>
	 A causal block diagram can contain strong components, which are loops. Such a strong component its values can be computed by solving a linear set of equations. To be able to do this,
	 the blocks in the strong component have to be representable by a linear equation. Blocks such as the comparison blocks, the modulo block and the logical and and or block can not be represented as a linear equation.
	 In checking the linearity of the strong component, the function returns false if one of these blocks are encountered. The product block is a special case. It can be represented as a linear equation if at least one of 
	 the values of the input ports is known, else it is not linear and a false value is returned by the function checking for linearity. If the product block has at least one known input and all other blocks in the strong component are also linear, then the strong component is linear
	 and the checking function returns a true value.

	In figure 1 is the CBD for the pseudo-random number generator. To view this on <a href="https://www.diagrams.net/"><tt>diagrams.net</tt></a> import the file <a href="./Pseudo-Random.drawio"><tt>Pseudo-Random.drawio</tt></a>.
	From this drawio file the python CBD has automatically been generated in <a href="./pseudo-random.py"><tt>pseudo-random.py</tt></a>. The initial value x0 is a constant 0 in figure 1. In the implementation this block can be assigned any constant number in the initialization of the CBD.
	By using a constant block instead of a input port for x0 in the drawing, there was no need to manually make a constant block to connect to the input port of x0. The only thing needed to be done was adding a input variable to the initialization of the CBD and 
	giving the constant block x0 the value of this variable. By running <a href="./pseudo-random.py"><tt>pseudo-random.py</tt></a>, the CBD is automatically simulated for every value x0 between 0 and 8. The period for every x0 is 9, so the generator its period does not depend on the initial x.
